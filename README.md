# SecureX Umbrella Webex Notifications

This SecureX workflow provides an ability to send Webex messages regarding the details of the last 10 (customisable) blocks in Umbrella. 

By default it sends the message as card in Umbrella containing:
- Date
- Time
- Internal IP
- Domain
- Category
- Device
- Link to Umbrella Dashboard

An example of the card can be seen below:
